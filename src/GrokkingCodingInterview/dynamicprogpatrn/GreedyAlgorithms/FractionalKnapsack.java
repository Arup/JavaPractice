Problem Statement #
You are given the capacity of a knapsack WW and a list of ‚Äã‚Äù‚Äã‚Äãn‚Äã‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã items that each have a certain value. Fractions of each item can be placed in the knapsack. Your goal is to implement a function for getting the maximum possible total value of VV in the knapsack.

Note: This problem is also known as the continuous\ knapsackcontinuous knapsack problem.

Input #
the inputs are the items as (value, weight)(value,weight) pairs and the knapsack capacity WW.

Output #
The output is the maximum possible value.

Sample input #
double[] weights = {2, 1, 6, 0.5, 0.25, 7};
double[] values = {50, 70, 100, 50, 30, 99};
int capacity = 10;

Sample output #
double result =  303.54;

üí° Did you know?
In the 0/1 Knapsack problem, we are not allowed to break the items. We either take the whole item or do not take it at all. However, here we can split the items.

    /*
    Explanation #
The key to solving this problem is that we can easily break the items to maximize the total value of the knapsack, just like you would to gold pieces.

Therefore, we can easily grab the item with the greatest ratio and break off the largest piece. The remainder of the bag can be filled with smaller ratio pieces, utilizing the maximum space.

Here, we calculate the ratio value/weightvalue/weight for each item and sort the items on the basis of this ratio.

Then, we take the items with the highest ratio and add them to the knapsack until we cannot add the next item as a whole. At the end, add as much of the next item as you can.

Time complexity #
Since the only step that takes major time is sorting algorithm, in the worst case, the whole solution takes O(n*lg(n))O(n‚àólg(n)), where nn is the total number of items available.
